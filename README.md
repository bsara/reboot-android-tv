Reboot Android TV
=================

This app allows you to reboot your Android TV device from the launcher home screen rather
than sideloading an already existing app that won't show up on the default Android TV
launcher.

Please note that this app is for **ROOTED DEVICES ONLY**.

This app was made because the Nexus Player does not come with any reboot functionality out
of the box. The only alternative is to sideload an app that allows for rebooting, and
before I made this app, no one else had made one that would show up in the default Android
TV launcher.

#### Current Features
