## What is it?

This app allows you to reboot your Android TV device from the launcher home screen rather than sideloading an already existing app that won't show up on the default Android TV launcher.

Please note that this app is for **ROOTED DEVICES ONLY**.

### Screenshots

## Why was it made?

Because the Nexus Player does not come with any reboot functionality out of the box. The only alternative is to sideload an app that allows for rebooting, and before I made this app, no one else had made one that would show up in the default Android TV launcher.
