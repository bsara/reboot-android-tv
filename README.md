This app allows you to reboot your Android TV device from the launcher home screen rather
than sideloading an already existing app that won't show up on the default Android TV
launcher.

Please note that this app is for **ROOTED DEVICES ONLY**.

This app was made because the Nexus Player originally did not come with any reboot
functionality out of the box. The only alternative is to sideload an app that allows for
rebooting, and before I made this app, no one else had made one that would show up in the
default Android TV launcher.

#### Current Features

- Reboot
- Reboot into Bootloader
- Reboot into Recovery

#### Upcoming Features

- Quick Reboot
- Enable/Disable TV Banner Icons for both full & quick reboot menus
