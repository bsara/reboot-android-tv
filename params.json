{"name":"Reboot Android TV","tagline":"A simple app for rebooting an Android TV quickly and easily","body":"[![Licensed under the CPOL v1.02](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-CPOL--1.02-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](http://bsara.github.io/reboot-android-tv/license)\r\n\r\n[![Gitter Chat](https://badges.gitter.im/JOIN%20CHAT.svg)](https://gitter.im/bsara/reboot-android-tv)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis app allows you to reboot your Android TV device from the launcher home screen rather\r\nthan sideloading an already existing app that won't show up on the default Android TV\r\nlauncher.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this app is for **ROOTED DEVICES ONLY**.\r\n\r\nThis app was made because the Nexus Player originally did not come with any reboot\r\nfunctionality out of the box. The only alternative was to sideload an app that allowed for\r\nrebooting and, before I made this app, no one else had made one that would show up in the\r\ndefault Android TV launcher.\r\n\r\n#### Current Features\r\n\r\n- Reboot\r\n- Reboot into Bootloader\r\n- Reboot into Recovery\r\n\r\n#### Upcoming Features\r\n\r\n- Quick Reboot\r\n- Enable/Disable TV Banner Icons for both full & quick reboot menus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\n- [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.bsara.android.tv.reboot)\r\n- [Direct Download](https://github.com/bsara/reboot-android-tv/releases/download/v1.0.0/io.github.bsara.android.tv.reboot_v1.0.0.apk)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsara/reboot-android-tv/master/play-store/screenshots/screenshot-0.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsara/reboot-android-tv/master/play-store/screenshots/screenshot-1.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsara/reboot-android-tv/master/play-store/screenshots/screenshot-2.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsara/reboot-android-tv/master/play-store/screenshots/screenshot-3.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
